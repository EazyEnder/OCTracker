# OCTracker

On-working mini-software to use a **tracking method** *(Intersection Over Union)* applied to **cell segmentation** using **Omnipose**.
The goal is to intelligently correct cells found using omnipose.

*Actually the best option is to use **TrackMate** on Fiji. This project is just a test to find/try correction methods.*
